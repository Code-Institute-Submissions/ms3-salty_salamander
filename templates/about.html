   <p>The Salty Salamander was developed in the heart of Cornwall with saltwater, sweat and a passion for devouring food. This site is for likeminded people who appreciate a good meal and exactly what goes into the taste.</p>
   <p>My name is Sam Sedgeman and I have hope you like this site as much as I did creaing it. I would love for this to become a place with a treasure trove of sensational recipes built by a friendly community of crazy foodies, hell bent on finding the next food craze.</p>
   <p>In my spare time I like to tinker wih code and make web based applications to aid me in everyday life. I love a new project, so if you have a idea for the site or a new project. please feel free to get in touch below...</p>
