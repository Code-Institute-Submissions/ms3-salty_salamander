# Milestone 3 Project
***
## Introduction &amp; Fulfilment
This project marks the milestone between the last three units( Python Fundamentals, Practical Python and Data Centric Development) and hopes to reflect on what I have learnt in these units. I have been tasked with creating a fully responsive CRUD web application. I have chosen the recipe brief and will continue to build an application the can CREATE recipes client side whilst feeding back to the connected database at the backend, READ through the existing recipes stored on the site, UPDATE the recipe records and finally DELETE recipe records that for valuable reason the recipe is no longer needed. It also neccessary to to design this website defensively, so the website is not vulnerable to attacks or vandalism through the front-end to the database. I have named my site "The Salty Salamander" and will allow registered users to login and use the CRUD functionality.
